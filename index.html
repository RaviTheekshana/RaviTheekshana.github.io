                <h2>Learn about turtles in Sri Lanka</h2>
                <p>Turtles are a successful group of animals that have seen the rise and fall of the dinosaurs. They have been on the planet for more than 100 million years and have persisted in large numbers up until recently. They originated from big, land-dwelling creatures that resembled tortoises. A head, short neck, two long fore flippers, two short, rounded hind flippers, and a tail make up their body. Internal organs are shielded by a structure (box) made up of the upper carapace and lower plastron. Sri Lanka is home to five species of sea turtles, which face various threats including habitat destruction, egg poaching, and plastic pollution. Several conservation efforts have been implemented to protect the turtle population, including marine protected areas and community-based conservation projects. However, illegal activities still pose a significant threat to these endangered species.</p>

                   Turtles are also known for their slow and steady pace. They are not the fastest creatures, but their persistence and determination help them to reach their goals. The saying "slow and steady wins the race" comes from the Aesop's fable of "The Tortoise and the Hare," which highlights the virtues of patience and perseverance.
                   turtles are omnivorous and eat a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, insects, and small animals. Some species are strict herbivores, while others are primarily carnivorous. Sea turtles, for example, eat mainly jellyfish, but also consume other marine animals such as crabs, shrimp, and fish.
                   Unfortunately, many species of turtles are threatened or endangered due to various factors such as habitat loss, pollution, and overhunting. Some species, such as the Chinese softshell turtle, have been hunted to near extinction due to their use in traditional medicine and the pet trade. Conservation efforts are being made around the world to protect turtles and their habitats, including captive breeding programs, habitat restoration, and anti-poaching initiatives.
                   In conclusion, turtles are fascinating creatures with many unique characteristics. Their shells, long lifespan, and slow and steady pace make them stand out from other animals. However, their survival is threatened due to human activities, and it is important to protect and conserve these amazing creatures and their habitats for future generations to enjoy.</p>

                    <h3>Head and Neck</h3>
                    <p>The skull of a turtle is distinct from other living amniotes,as it is solid and hard and lacks any spaces for the attachment of muscles.
                        Some turtle species have grown thick, big heads that allow for more muscle mass and more powerful bites.

                    <h3>Shell</h3>
                    <p>Among vertebrates,a turtle is the only one
                        with a shell that shields the animal from the elements.
                        It has two portions,the domed dorsal   (back) carapace and the flattened ventra l (belly) plastron,and is mostly composed of 50-60 bones.

                    <h3>Limbs and locomotion</h3>
                    <p>Turtles move slowly onland because of their bulky
                        shells. A desert tortoise can only move about 0.14- 30 mph (0.22-0.48 km/h).Sea turtles can swim at a speed of 30 km/h (19 mph),in comparison.
                        The majority of turtles have five toes.
