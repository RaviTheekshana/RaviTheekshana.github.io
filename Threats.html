                <h3>Sea Polution Caused by Plastic</h3>
                <p>The pollution caused by plastic in the sea has devastating effects on marine life, particularly sea turtles. Millions of tonnes of plastic debris find their way into the oceans every year, where it poses a significant threat to marine species. Sea turtles often mistake floating plastic rubbish for food and ingest it. As they can't digest it, this eventually causes blockages that can lead to starvation or death. Additionally, plastic waste can entangle or snare sea turtles, resulting in injuries or drowning. The devastating effects of pollution on sea turtles are not only harmful to individual animals but can also affect the survival of entire populations.
                     Action needs to be taken to tackle plastic pollution to protect these amazing creatures and the marine environment.Turtles eat plastic, get caught in it, have to wade through it in the water and on beaches,
                     and microplastic can affect nests and hatchlings.</p>

                <h3>Entanglement in fish gear</h3>
                <p>Entanglement in fishing gear is a significant threat to sea turtles. They can become trapped in nets, lines, and other underwater fishing equipment, which can lead to serious injuries and even death. The turtles may be unable to free themselves, and if they do manage to escape, they may do so with severe injuries or long-term health problems. In addition to direct physical harm, entanglement can also lead to increased stress levels, which can suppress the turtle's immune system and make them more vulnerable to disease. It is crucial to reduce the risk of
                     entanglement in fishing gear for the survival of sea turtles and the health of our ocean ecosystems.</p>

                <h3>Global Warmings</h3>
                <p>Sea turtles are highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming, which is causing rising sea levels, changes in ocean currents, and increasing ocean temperatures. Rising sea levels lead to a loss of nesting beaches and inundation of existing nests, while changing ocean currents can affect their ability to find food. The rising temperatures of the oceans can also cause coral bleaching, reducing the availability of food for sea turtles.

                    Additionally, global warming can alter the sex ratio of sea turtle hatchlings. Temperature influences the gender of hatchlings, and a warmer nest can produce more females than males, affecting the population's genetic diversity.
                     Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the ocean can also affect sea turtle's sense of direction, complicating migratory patterns and navigation.
                    As a result of these changes, sea turtle populations are declining globally due to the negative consequences of climate change. Urgent actions are necessary to mitigate the effects of global warming to save sea turtles and other marine species.</p>
