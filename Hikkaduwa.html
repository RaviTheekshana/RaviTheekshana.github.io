            <h2 class="heading">HIKKADUWA TURTLE HATCHERY, SRI LANKA</h2>
                <p>Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery, located in the southern coast of Sri Lanka, is a must-visit destination for tourists who wish to witness the rare sight of newly hatched turtles making their way to the sea. Started in 1986, the hatchery has played a significant role in conserving the sea turtle population in Sri Lanka.

                    The hatchery is run by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society, a non-profit organization that aims to protect the endangered species of sea turtles. Visitors can learn about these fascinating creatures and the conservation efforts taken by the hatchery to protect them from poachers and other dangers.
                    
                    The main attraction of the Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is the turtle hatchery process. Here, visitors can observe the process of eggs being hatched in the incubation chamber before being released into the sea. The hatchery releases tens of thousands of turtle hatchlings every year into the sea. The release takes place at night as it is the safest time for the hatchlings to make their way to the ocean.
                    
                    Apart from the hatchery process, visitors can also witness the rehabilitation process of injured turtles. The hatchery provides medical attention and care for turtles that have been injured due to human activity or natural causes. Once they are healed, they are released back into their natural habitat.
                    
                    The hatchery also houses a small museum that educates visitors about the different species of sea turtles found in Sri Lanka and the dangers they face in their natural habitats. Visitors can also learn about the conservation efforts taken by the hatchery and how they can contribute to the cause.
                    
                    In addition to its educational value, the Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery also provides employment to the local community. The hatchery employs individuals from the nearby villages to help with the hatchery process and to educate visitors about the conservation efforts of the hatchery.
                    
                    In conclusion, the Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is a wonderful place to visit for those interested in learning about sea turtle conservation efforts. It serves an important purpose in protecting the endangered species of sea turtles and provides an educational experience for visitors.</p>
